biztime further study exercise with test


Write some tests!

Make sure that your routes are tested, use jest –coverage to see how well you have tested your routes.

Slugify Company Names

It might be difficult for customers to make up a customer code themselves when making new companies (preferably, they should have no spaces or weird punctuation, and should be all lower-case).

Fortunately, there’s an NPM library that can help out, slugify. Read about this, and then change the POST /companies route so that they don’t provide a code directly, but you make this by using slugify() on the given name.

Allow paying of invoices

Change the logic of this route:

PUT /invoices/[id]
Updates an invoice.

If invoice cannot be found, returns a 404.

Needs to be passed in a JSON body of {amt, paid}

If paying unpaid invoice: sets paid_date to today
If un-paying: sets paid_date to null
Else: keep current paid_date
Returns: {invoice: {id, comp_code, amt, paid, add_date, paid_date}}

Add a Many-to-Many

A larger feature.

Add a table for “industries”, where there is a code and an industry field (for example: “acct” and “Accounting”).

Add a table that allows an industry to be connected to several companies and to have a company belong to several industries.

Add some sample data (by hand in psql is fine).

Change this route:

when viewing details for a company, you can see the names of the industries for that company
Add routes for:

adding an industry
listing all industries, which should show the company code(s) for that industry
associating an industry to a company
